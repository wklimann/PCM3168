PCM3168
=======

This repo contains VHDL files for an I2S interface, designed for the PCM3168 audio interface from Texas Instrumnts. 
With slightly modifications it should also be useful for other codecs and projects.

The I2S-input and the -output are designed as slave interfaces but the clock generator allows to use them as a master interfaces.
